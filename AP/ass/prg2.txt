2. Write a complete 'c' program that will accept the following information for each team in
 either football or baseball league:
 a. Team name
 b. City
 c. Number of wins
 For a baseball team, add the following information
	 I. Number of hits
	 II. Number of runs
 	III. No. of errors
 	IV. No. of extra-timing games
 Similarly add the following for a football team
 	I. No. of ties
 	II. No. of field goals	
	III. No. of touchdowns
	IV. No. of turn overs
 Enter this information for all the teams in the league then reorder and print the list of teams
 according to their win-lose records.
